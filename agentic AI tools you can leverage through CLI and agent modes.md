Claude Code is an excellent agentic AI tool. Here's how to leverage it effectively based on the latest best practices and features:
Essential Claude Code Workflow Tips
1. Use /clear Frequently
Use /clear often. Every time you start something new, clear the chat. AI agents tend to become more unpredictable the longer a conversation goes. This is especially true when you're asking different questions. Claude Code overview - Anthropic
2. Skip Permission Prompts for Efficiency
Every time I open Claude Code, I hit Command+C and run claude --dangerously-skip-permissions. It's not as dangerous as it sounds — think of it as Cursor's old yolo mode. Claude Code overview - Anthropic
3. Leverage Advanced Thinking Modes
We recommend using the word "think" to trigger extended thinking mode. These specific phrases are mapped directly to increasing levels of thinking budget: "think" < "think hard" < "think harder" < "ultrathink." Each level allocates progressively more thinking budget for Claude to use. How To Use Claude Code To Wield Coding Agent Clusters | PulseMCP
Example prompts:
bashclaude "ultrathink about how to refactor this authentication system"
claude "think harder about the optimal database schema for this feature"

4. Sub-Agents for Specialized Tasks
Claude Code subagents are specialized assistants that you can create for specific tasks. Each subagent operates with its own context window, custom system prompt, and specific tool permissions. How I Use Claude Code | Philipp Spiess
You can set up different sub-agents to review code, test code, and update documentation. You ↔ Main Claude (coordinator) ├── Code Reviewer (quality specialist) ├── Test Engineer (testing specialist) └── Documentation Writer (technical writing specialist) Claude Code Best Practices \ Anthropic
5. Research-Plan-Code Workflow
Steps #1-#2 are crucial—without them, Claude tends to jump straight to coding a solution. Ask Claude to research and plan first significantly improves performance for problems requiring deeper thinking upfront. GitHub - hesreallyhim/awesome-claude-code: A curated list of awesome commands, files, and workflows for Claude Code
Recommended sequence:

Research: "Research the best approaches for [problem]"
Plan: "Create a detailed implementation plan"
Code: "Implement the solution following your plan"

6. Test-Driven Development with Claude
Ask Claude to write tests based on expected input/output pairs. Be explicit about the fact that you're doing test-driven development so that it avoids creating mock implementations. Tell Claude to run the tests and confirm they fail. Ask Claude to commit the tests when you're satisfied with them.

Power User Techniques
7. Use Visual Context
This is particularly useful when working with design mocks as reference points for UI development, and visual charts for analysis and debugging. GitHub - hesreallyhim/awesome-claude-code: A curated list of awesome commands, files, and workflows for Claude Code
Paste images directly into Claude Code to give visual context for UI work.
8. Leverage Tab Completion and File References
Use tab-completion to quickly reference files or folders anywhere in your repository, helping Claude find or update the right resources. GitHub - hesreallyhim/awesome-claude-code: A curated list of awesome commands, files, and workflows for Claude Code
9. Create Disposable Tools
With AI, code is becoming really cheap. This means that you can now build stuff that you only ever use once without feeling bad about it. Everything that you wish would make your current task easier can just be created out of thin air.
Examples:

Migration progress dashboards
One-off data analysis scripts
Custom CLI tools for specific tasks

10. Use Planning Mode
Claude Code has a built-in planning mode, that is triggered when you press Shift+Tab twice.
Advanced Workflow Patterns
11. Git Worktrees for Agent Clusters
The ability to manage clusters of coding agents in parallel. Each of which is ultimately nearly as capable as the software engineer who is managing them. I think it's conceivable someone could handle up to ~10 at once, giving new meaning to the phrase "10x engineer."

12. Context Management
If you do get to a point where you're running out of context but can't clear it all yet, you can use /compact with instructions on what to save: /compact Focus on preserving our current authentication implementation and the database schema decisions we've made. Claude Code Best Practices \ Anthropic
13. Keyboard Shortcuts to Master
Pasting images from clipboard doesn't work with Command+V. Use Control+V instead. Stopping Claude isn't Control+C (that just exits entirely). Use Escape to actually stop Claude. Jumping to previous messages: Escape twice shows a list of all previous messages you can jump back to. Claude Code overview - Anthropic
Integration and Extensibility
14. MCP (Model Context Protocol) Integration
Claude Code supports MCP servers for enhanced capabilities:

Connect to external tools and APIs
Custom integrations with your development workflow
Extended functionality beyond built-in tools

15. Scriptable Workflows
Claude Code is composable and scriptable. tail -f app.log | claude -p "Slack me if you see any anomalies appear in this log stream" works. Your CI can run claude -p "If there are new text strings, translate them into French and raise a PR for @lang-fr-team to review". Cooking with Claude Code: The Complete Guide - Sid Bharath
Cost Optimization
16. Claude Max Subscription
You'll probably want a Claude Max subscription to use Claude Code generously for $100 - 200/mo, otherwise you're going to run up a pretty big API bill (likely in the many hundreds, if not breaching a thousand, per month).

Practical Starting Points
For immediate impact, try these commands:
bash# Start with a clear context
claude

# Use thinking modes for complex problems
"ultrathink about architecting a scalable microservices system"

# Research-first approach
"Research modern React state management patterns, then plan an implementation"

# TDD workflow
"Write comprehensive tests for a user authentication system, then implement it"

# Visual context
[Paste design mockup] "Implement this design using Tailwind CSS"
The key is treating Claude Code as a sophisticated pair programmer that excels when given clear context, specific instructions, and the right thinking budget for the complexity of your tasks.Retryfree_tier_framework.json234 linesjsonfree_tier_orchestrator.txt460 linestxtfree_tier_setup.sh522 linesshfree_tier_guide.md396 linesmdframework_readme (1).md252 linesmdDHow do these documents need to change to reflect agentic Ai In the workflow. Claude is the most expensive and should be reserved for complex taskEditStrategized workflow optimization with Claude for complex tasks.The user is asking me to analyze the documents they've provided and suggest changes to reflect agentic AI in the workflow, specifically noting that Claude is the most expensive and should be reserved for complex tasks.
Looking at the documents, they describe a "Free-Tier Multi-Agent Development Framework" that currently focuses on:

Using free tiers (Gemini CLI, Codeium, etc.)
Local models via Ollama
Git worktree-based lanes for different development tasks
Quota management and service rotation

The user wants to incorporate agentic AI into this workflow, with Claude Code being used specifically for complex tasks due to its cost.
Key changes needed:

Service Priority Restructuring: Since Claude Code is expensive, it should be positioned as the "premium" option for complex tasks, not the primary choice
Agentic Workflow Integration: The framework needs to incorporate the agentic patterns we discussed earlier (research-plan-code, sub-agents, etc.)
Task Complexity Classification: Need to classify tasks by complexity to determine which AI service to use
Cost Optimization: Better cost management given Claude Code's expense
Agentic Tool Integration: Include tools like Aider, Continue, and Claude Code in the service rotation
Workflow Patterns: Incorporate the advanced agentic patterns like TDD, multi-agent collaboration, etc.

Let me think through the specific changes needed for each document:

Framework Config JSON: Needs to include Claude Code as a premium service, task complexity classification, agentic workflow patterns
Orchestrator Script: Needs complexity assessment, better cost controls for Claude Code
Setup Script: Needs to install Claude Code and other agentic tools
Guide: Needs to explain when to use which service based on complexity
README: Needs to reflect the agentic approach and cost considerations
These documents need significant updates to incorporate agentic AI workflows while treating Claude Code as a premium, cost-controlled service. Here are the key changes needed:

}
8. Enhanced Usage Guide
Add section on agentic workflows:
markdown## 🤖 Agentic AI Workflow Patterns

### Task Complexity Assessment

Before starting any task, assess complexity:

```bash
# Analyze your task automatically
pwsh ./orchestrator.ps1 -Command analyze-task -Message "Refactor authentication system to use OAuth2"

# Output:
# 🎯 Task Complexity: complex
# 🤖 Recommended Service: claude_code
# 💡 Consider breaking into smaller tasks for cost optimization
Research → Plan → Code Pattern
For complex tasks, use the three-phase approach:
bash# Phase 1: Research (Free tier)
pwsh ./orchestrator.ps1 -Command start-lane -Lane research
gemini "research OAuth2 implementation patterns for Node.js"

# Phase 2: Planning (Claude Code for architecture)  
pwsh ./orchestrator.ps1 -Command start-lane -Lane complex_design
claude "ultrathink about OAuth2 architecture for our system"

# Phase 3: Implementation (Local/Free)
pwsh ./orchestrator.ps1 -Command start-lane -Lane ai_coding
aider --model ollama/codellama:7b-instruct "implement the OAuth2 flow"
Cost-Optimized Development
bash# Morning: Check Claude Code budget
pwsh ./orchestrator.ps1 -Command cost-report

# Use free tiers for routine work
aider --model gemini/gemini-1.5-pro "add error handling"

# Reserve Claude Code for complex decisions
claude "ultrathink about database schema optimization"

## 9. **Updated Cost Structure**

```markdown
## 💰 Agentic Cost Optimization

| Service | Use Case | Daily Limit | Cost/Request | Best For |
|---------|----------|-------------|--------------|----------|
| Gemini CLI | Research, Simple tasks | 1,000 | Free | Information gathering |
| Claude Code | Complex reasoning | 50 | ~$0.15 | Architecture, Analysis |
| Aider + Local | Implementation | Unlimited | Free | Code generation |
| Ollama | Fallback | Unlimited | Free | Everything offline |

**Smart Usage Pattern:**
- Morning: Research with Gemini (free)
- Midday: Plan with Claude Code (premium) 
- Afternoon: Implement with Aider + Local (free)
- Evening: Review and integrate (free)

**Monthly Budget Example:**
- Claude Code: 30 requests/day × 0.15 = $4.50/day = $135/month
- Everything else: Free
- **vs Commercial alternatives: $500+/month**
These changes transform the framework into a true agentic system that:

Intelligently routes tasks based on complexity
Minimizes Claude Code usage through smart alternatives
Implements agentic patterns like research-plan-code
Provides cost transparency and optimization
Maintains professional capabilities while controlling costs

The key insight is treating Claude Code as the "senior architect" that you consult for complex decisions, while using free/local tools for the bulk of implementation work.
