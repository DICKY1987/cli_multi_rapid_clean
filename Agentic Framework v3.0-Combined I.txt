Agentic Framework v3.0 – Combined Implementation Tasks and Gap Analysis


This document consolidates the implementation tasks, missing components, and environmental considerations for the Agentic Framework v3.0 project. It distills the critical, high‑priority and medium‑priority work items from the original task decomposition and expanded checklists, and surfaces additional gaps called out in the standard development notes. The intent of this unified document is to serve as a signal document for project stakeholders and auditing agents to understand what remains to be built and to prioritise remediation.


1. Critical Tasks & Missing Components (Tier 1)
Component        Description & Required Actions        Notes
Service client implementations        Implement real clients for Anthropic (Claude 3), Gemini (Google Generative AI), Aider (local CLI), and Ollama (local LLM). Provide error handling and process management. Create a src/services/ directory with anthropic_client.py, gemini_client.py, ollama_client.py, aider_client.py and a base_client.py for shared logic. Plug these clients into the service router.        Currently there are empty placeholder classes in agentic_framework_v3.py and no src/services/ directory. Without these classes the system cannot call any LLMs or tools.
Agent tool implementations        Populate each agent’s tools array with real tool instances. Researcher agents require WebSearchTool, DocumentReaderTool, FileAnalysisTool; implementers require CodeAnalysisTool, GitTool, TestingTool; additional tools like GitHubAPITool and FileSystemTool are needed for full coverage.        All agents currently specify tools=[], which leaves them non‑functional. Each tool class must be implemented or imported and wired into the agent definitions.
Database schema & migrations        Provide a complete DatabaseManager with methods to create, retrieve, update and query WorkflowExecution records, and initialise a SQLite database. Configure Alembic for migrations (alembic init, alembic revision --autogenerate, alembic upgrade head).        There is no working database initialisation or migration logic; the DatabaseManager in agentic_framework_v3.py is incomplete.
Environment configuration        Create a config.py using pydantic_settings.BaseSettings to manage API keys (Anthropic, Google, OpenAI), Redis URL, database URL, service limits, default Git branch, lanes config path and allowed file patterns. Provide a .env.example and ensure settings validation.        Environment variables are referenced but not validated; no config.py exists.
LangGraph workflow implementation        Implement the actual state machine transitions in the LangGraphWorkflowEngine. Fill in _execute_task() to select a service client, construct an execution context, call execute_task() and update the workflow state (status, results, cost). Add error recovery logic, retry mechanisms and optional human‑in‑the‑loop checkpoints.        _execute_task() is currently a pass. Without workflow logic, no tasks can be executed.
Redis quota manager integration        Instantiate the quota manager and connect it to the service router to enforce daily cost limits across services.        A QuotaManager class exists but is never used.
Git worktree integration        Initialise and inject a GitLaneManager into LangGraphWorkflowEngine to create isolated worktrees per lane. Implement _setup_worktree() to call create_lane_worktree() and set state.worktree_path, with fallback when no lane is selected or errors occur.        langgraph_git_integration.py is present but not connected to the orchestrator.
Database & API migrations        Provide proper database initialisation scripts and integrate migration logic into the deployment process.        Without migrations the database may drift from the data model.
2. High‑Priority and Additional Tasks (Tier 2 & Tier 3)
Component        Description & Required Actions        Notes
Monitoring & logging        Create monitoring/prometheus.yml to scrape metrics from the agentic framework (e.g., /metrics) and Redis. Configure Grafana datasources (monitoring/grafana-datasources.yml) and dashboards (e.g., cost tracking, service usage, error rates). Wire these into Docker Compose.        Monitoring files are missing entirely.
Test suite        Set up tests/unit/ and tests/integration/ directories with Pytest. Provide unit tests for the CostOptimizedServiceRouter, QuotaManager, ComplexityAnalyzer and other core classes. Implement integration tests for the workflow engine and API endpoints. Add fixtures and configure coverage reporting.        The noxfile.py references tests that do not exist.
VS Code extension        Initialise a VS Code extension under extensions/orchestrator-console/ with a package.json defining commands (e.g., agenticDev.executeTask, agenticDev.showStatus), a basic TypeScript implementation (src/extension.ts) and a WebSocket connection to the Python backend. Provide a simple status view.        Only the extension specification exists; no files are present.
Workflow enhancements        Add robust error recovery logic and retry strategies in state transitions. Implement human approval checkpoints for critical tasks.        The workflow engine lacks transitions beyond a placeholder.
Redis cost/quota management        Fully wire up the CostOptimizedQuotaManager to enforce daily cost and request limits per service.        Without quota management, cost tracking is incomplete.
Environment & dev containers        Provide a .vscode/settings.json with recommended Python interpreter paths, linting and formatting settings (e.g., Black, isort, Pylint), and exclude rules for caches and virtual environments. Recommend a dev container configuration (.devcontainer/) for reproducible environments, or clearly document the manual VS Code extension setup.        The current documentation lists extension recommendations but lacks concrete settings and dev container configuration.
CLI enhancements        Extend the CLI to support status (detailed metrics), config (edit settings), history (view execution logs) and rollback (recover from failures).        The CLI currently only exposes basic commands.
Authentication & security        Implement API key management, user session handling, rate limiting per user and JWT validation. Add input sanitisation and CORS configuration to protect the API.        There is no security layer in place.
CI/CD pipeline        Add GitHub Actions or an equivalent workflow to automate linting, testing and deployment.        The repository has no CI/CD configuration.
3. Medium‑Priority Enhancements & Considerations (Tier 4)
Component        Description & Required Actions
CLI & developer experience        Provide commands to inspect agent status, configure environment settings and view recent executions. Ensure the CLI surfaces helpful error messages and progress indicators.
Code quality & documentation        Add inline docstrings, type hints and high‑level architectural diagrams. Refine planning documents to match the actual codebase once implemented.
Dev container & workspace consistency        Adopt VS Code dev containers or a similar solution to ensure consistent environments across team members. For manual setups, include .vscode/settings.json, tasks and debug configurations for FastAPI and asynchronous workers.
User interface & dashboards        Create simple dashboards in Grafana to visualise cost usage, agent performance and error rates. Provide UI hooks in the VS Code extension to display these metrics.
Optional managed services        Evaluate off‑the‑shelf solutions such as LangGraph Cloud and CrewAI Pro. Adopting these managed services could reduce development effort by ~90% compared with a fully custom implementation.
4. Failure Modes to Avoid


Service integration hell – Attempting to implement all service clients and tools at once may lead to complexity. Start with one working service and incrementally add others.


Configuration drift – Avoid hard‑coding values; centralise all configuration in the Settings class and environment variables.


Testing afterthought – Implement basic unit and integration tests alongside each new feature to prevent regressions.


Git integration complexity – Begin with simple worktree creation; add advanced lane logic later.


VS Code extension bloat – Keep the extension lightweight; heavy processing should remain in the Python backend.


5. Success Metrics & Implementation Order
Phase        Success criteria
Week 1 (Critical)        At least one AI service client functioning end‑to‑end; database operations working; basic task execution in the workflow engine.
Week 2 (High)        Multiple service clients integrated; Git worktree integration functional; environment configuration file working.
Week 3 (Medium)        VS Code extension operational; test suite covering core functionality; monitoring infrastructure in place.


Recommended implementation order:


Service clients – build at least one functional client and integrate it into the service router.


Tools array and service router – replace empty tool lists with real instances and wire up service clients.


Database & environment configuration – create the settings class, initialise the SQLite DB and implement basic migrations.


Git integration – connect the git lane manager and worktree creation.


Workflow logic – implement task execution and error handling.


Monitoring and tests – start adding monitoring, VS Code extension scaffolding and unit/integration tests.


6. Decision Paths & Reality Check


The current codebase consists largely of architectural documents with minimal functional implementation. There are three viable paths forward:


Path A: Managed services (recommended) – Leverage managed orchestration solutions like LangGraph Cloud and CrewAI Pro. This drastically reduces custom code, accelerates deployment and lowers maintenance. Estimated cost: ≈$99/month; saves several weeks of engineering effort.


Path B: Complete custom implementation – Continue building the described multi‑agent framework from scratch. Expect 40–60 hours of development plus ongoing maintenance of 3000+ lines of additional code.


Path C: Hybrid approach – Use LangGraph for workflows while implementing a custom cost optimisation layer and agent tools. Focus effort on the unique value proposition of the project.


Before proceeding, weigh the complexity of building and maintaining a bespoke orchestration layer against the availability of mature managed services.


Summary: The Agentic Framework v3.0 is at the foundation stage – the architecture is defined, but core integrations (service clients, tools, database, workflow engine) are stubs. To reach a functional system, implement the critical components listed above, establish robust monitoring and testing, and consider whether managed services could accelerate delivery.


This document synthesizes the various implementation and setup files into a single reference.


I’ve also tailored the Senior Systems Architect prompt to be project‑specific, updating the purpose, mission, success criteria and quality gates to reflect the combined tasks and gaps. The modified prompt is here:
