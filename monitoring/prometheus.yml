"""
Prometheus scrape configuration for the Agentic Framework.

This sample configuration scrapes metrics from the FastAPI application
running on port 8000 as well as a local Redis instance on port 6379.
Adjust the targets based on your deployment. To enable metrics in your
application, expose an endpoint (e.g. ``/metrics``) that provides a
Prometheus compatible output using a library such as ``prometheus_fastapi_instrumentator``.
