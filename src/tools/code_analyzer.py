"""Code analysis tool.

This tool provides a placeholder for static analysis of source code. It
could integrate with linters such as ``ruff`` or ``pylint`` to report
issues, compute complexity metrics, or generate documentation. The stub
implementation simply returns the number of lines in the file.
